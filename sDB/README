sDB is a program that utilizes the rednet api to authenticate clients over a network.
It will read from a tokens database ("/tokens"), and/or an optional secondary server, and reply with "true" over the network
to the sender of the request, if the token exists. Otherwise, "false" is returned.

Optional Client restriction and backdoor functionality is available in the configuration starting on line 13 of the program.
